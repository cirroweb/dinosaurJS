So let’s have some high-level banter about the state of tech, the future of tech, and your place in the whole thing as a developer.

        description: "Today’s most popular frameworks come from a time when the world was a different place. Ember’s first rendering engine, for example, was optimized around the performance gotchas of Internet Explorer 6. IE6 has since faded into history, and smartphones with spotty connectivity and occasionally dodgy hardware have become the lowest common denominator that we must optimize for. In this talk, we’ll discuss how smartphones fundamentally change the assumptions we make about architecting applications for the web. Then, we’ll cover how we can embrace these new mobile constraints to build even better apps—for everyone. Finally, we’ll look at the techniques used by desktop-era libraries and what they’re doing to become great for the mobile web.",

There's a wealth of ideas out there for cranking up performance, but how do you know where to start? What if you work for days to ship an optimization that doesn't really pay off? In this talk, you'll learn how to experiment and fail fast. You'll find out how to quickly and rigorously assess your optimization ideas with open source tools, and how to share your results so that others can replicate your findings.",

Using pure functions called actions and reducers, Redux allows us to bridge the gap from a specific React component to that universal state. Although this has made front-end life easier, a remaining challenge is how to handle the events that need to happen in between the action and reducer.

If you're in this situation, don't despair! There is a light at the end of the garbagey-UI tunnel: you can avoid these user-centric pitfalls even when you're strapped for cash, short on time, and without the budget to bring on a designer.
